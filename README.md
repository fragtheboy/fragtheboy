Howdy, my name is Pratham, a junior year computer science and engineering undergraduate.

I am polyglot developer, who primarily uses statically typed languages- Rust, C, C++, Go, Typescript, Java (however, I have coded a lot of JavaScript and Python before.)

My interests lie in building command line utilites; Mutli-threaded development; OpenGL; WebGL; Web development using web assembly; and, machine learning algorithms (BTW using C/C++).

I have spent 2 years of my life in web development using HTML, CSS & JavaScript + JavaScript libraries/frameworks (worst mistake of my life), so I kind of posses a good amount of knowledge in it (because I can code my own vanilla javascript single page application router)

BTW I use an Arch-based Linux(Manjaro), and I use VIM for development.

Currently, I am practising/learning Discrete Mathematics, Machine Learning and Cross-Platform Development.

Thanks for visiting.
